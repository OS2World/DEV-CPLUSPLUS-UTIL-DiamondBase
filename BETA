Recently, you mailed Darren Platt concerning a C++ Programmers Database
that we have been writing. The product is called DiamondBase and is now
ready for a round of beta testing.

Please read the Copyright file for our almost entirely non fascist
requirements. Additionally, the following conditions are added for beta
testers.

	Please do not give this beta to other people (except those working
	with you). We are happy for them to beta test for us, but would rather
	they come through us so we have a list of our beta testers. We do not
	want beta copies distributed all over the place, making support for the
	package once it is released difficult.

	We would also not suggest incorporating beta code into a distributable
	package. It is far wiser to wait for a release version (which,
	depending on how quickly you analyse this version, shouldn't be too far
	away).

At the bottom of this mail, and in subsequent mail, you will find a
uuencoded version of diamond.tar.Z. Remove the mail headers and this
rambling and uudecode the file.

The .tar.Z file is also available via anonymous ftp from
pippin.cs.monash.edu.au in /pub/export.

After that extract the package from diamond.tar.Z.
The easiest way to do this is:
	zcat diamond.tar.Z | tar -xf -

This will create a diamond subdirectory under the current directory. Please
read the README file in that directory. It has instructions.

When (or if) you find a bug, please send us a description of the problem,
any input and output that is relevant _AND_ the code that caused it (enough
code for us to repeat it). Also, we would appreciate it if you could send
us any applications you write so that we may determine how people are using
the package, what calls are more frequently used and general usage patterns
etc. We will not do anythying with this code other than use it for
statistical purposes.

Good luck, we look forward to hearing from you.
