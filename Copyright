Ok - now for the tricky part - charging for software which incorporates any
part of the DiamondBase package. We are a little undecided on this point
and would like some feedback on what people want to do with it first. It
personally strikes us as grossly unfair that someone could potentially make
obscene quantities of money out of our hard work whilst we make nothing except
a little kudos (bug levels permitting).

So ... if you would like to make commercial use of DiamondBase - or buy the
rights to it - we would love to discuss this with you. We are unlikely to
exact enormous demands, but would like some return on our investment.
The bottom line is 

** COMMERCIAL USE OF THIS SOFTWARE REQUIRES THE EXPRESS PERMISSION OF
                          THE AUTHORS                                  **

That notwithstanding, we would like DiamondBase to become a popular
choice for small database implementations - and so we may well end up
putting the GNU Public License on it to encourage usage. We will reserve
our decision pending feedback however - we are essentially nice people who
don't want to be exploited.
